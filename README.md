# Convexity Risk in a Fixed Income Book

Article illustration — Jason Bell, 2026

This module demonstrates:
  1. Bond pricing from yield (present value of cash flows)
  2. Modified duration  — first-order price sensitivity to yield
  3. Convexity         — second-order correction (the bit duration misses)
  4. P&L approximation — duration-only vs duration + convexity
  5. A simple book-level convexity report across multiple positions

The point: duration tells you which way the bus is going.
Convexity tells you whether the driver has been drinking.
